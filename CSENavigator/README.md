<h1> CSENavigator </h1> <br/>

This was the final app that was submitted to show proof of concept of indoor navigation inside a mall and which can be used to reccomend deals of nearby stores.<br/>

<ul>

  <li> Demo was shown to work in IIT Kharagpur CSE Department. <br/>

  <li> First when starting the app we see predicted location based on WiFi triangulation method. User starts the navigation by providing Source(If prediction was inaccurate) and Destination location. <br/>If the source info is not given than predicted location is taken as source location.

 <li> Than the app shows real time tracking of user based on accelerometer and gyroscope sensors only. The app also shows shortest path to destination as directions. <br/>
